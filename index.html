<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>I am an undergraduate at Villanova University. I'm set to graduate in May 2018.</br>
  I am a computer science major with a concentration in cognitive science and a minor in classical studies.</br>
  In December 2017 I plan to apply to PhD programs in computer science.</p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Although I consider my primary interest to be machine learning, I'm also interested in the mind and congition.</br>
  I currently research deep learning, computer vision, and some natural langauge processing. At this point I have approached these</br>
  topics primarily from a computational perspective. Moving forward, I hope to integrate the study of the mind in my research,</br>
  working at the convergence of computer and cognitive science.
